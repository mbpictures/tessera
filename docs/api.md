# API
Tessera has a flexible configuration RESTful API. You can find a detailed documentation [here](https://mbpictures.github.io/tessera/api/).

## Creating an api key
To access the api using a custom client, you need to generate an api key.
To do so, click on the profile icon in the top right corner of the admin page and then click the ```settings``` button.
Open the ```Api-keys``` accordion and click the ```Add api key``` button. Enter an optional name for the key (e.g. the
client name) and click generate. Store the generated api key, as it can not be recovered once you closed the dialog.
